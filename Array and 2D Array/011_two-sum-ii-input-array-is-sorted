// 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted


// Explain Given 1-indexed array of integer
// A 1-indexed array is an array where the first element is accessed with the index 1 instead of the typical 0 used in most programming languages. 
// For example, if you have a 1-indexed array like this:
// A = [5, 10, 15, 20]
// The elements would be accessed as follows:
// A[1] would give you 5
// A[2] would give you 10
// A[3] would give you 15
// A[4] would give you 20

// sorted in non decreasing order means in c++ ??
// "sorted in non-decreasing order," it means that the elements are arranged such that each element is less than or equal to the next element
// A[i]â‰¤A[i+1]
